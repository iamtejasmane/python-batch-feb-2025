# Variables

# Defining different types of variables
name = "Harry"  # String variable
age = 17  # Integer variable
height = 5.4  # Float variable
is_student = True  # Boolean variable

# Printing variable values
print(name)
print(age)
print(height)
print(is_student)

# Naming Conventions (Rules for Naming Variables)

# 1. Variable names must start with a letter or an underscore (_)
# Allowed: a-z, A-Z, or _

# Valid examples:
abc = 1  # Starts with a letter
_no = 2  # Starts with an underscore

# Invalid examples:
# 007 = 1  # Cannot start with a number

# 2. Special characters cannot be used except for underscore (_)
# Invalid characters: ! @ # $ & *

# 3. Case Sensitivity - Variable names are case-sensitive
Name = "John"  # Different from 'name'
print(Name)

# 4. Cannot use Python reserved keywords as variable names
# Example of an invalid variable:
# class = "Math"  # 'class' is a reserved keyword

# Printing information of an Employee
emp_first_name = "John"
emp_last_name = "Week"
emp_profession = "Contractor"
emp_salary = 120000

# Displaying employee details
print(emp_first_name, emp_last_name, emp_profession, emp_salary)
